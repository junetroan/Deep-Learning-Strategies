# Deep Learning Strategies
This repository is the working repository for my master's thesis, where I deep dive into how novel deep learning strategies can be used for time series forecasting. The developed strategies are presented below.

The work has consisted of understanding state-of-the-art models, developing novel strategies, and testing both existing and novel strategies throughout four case studies. The case studies performed during this work are the following:
- **Lotka Volterra system (Ecology/Applied Mathematics):** Synthetic data from an LV system, which is often used in cases where nonlinear, dynamic systems are analysed.
- **Hare and Lynx system (Ecology):** Real-world data from the Hare and Lynx ecosystem recorded through 80 consecutive years. 
- **Nasdaq Composite (Finance):** Real-world historical data of the Nasdaq Composite.
- **F1 Telemetry (Engineering):** Real-world data from high-performance engineering system - specifically, the telementry from a Formula One race
