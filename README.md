# Deep Learning Strategies
This repository is the working repository for my master's thesis, where I deep dive into how novel deep learning strategies can be used for time series forecasting. The developed strategies, testing strategies and status of results are presented in this README. 

## üöÄ Developed Strategies
- Augmented Neural Ordinary Differential Equations using Multiple Shooting (ANODE-MS)
- Modified Neural Ordinary Differential Equations using Multiple Shooting (MNODE-MS)
- Neural Prediction Error Method (NPEM)

## üßê Testing Strategies
- Augmented Neural Ordinary Differential Equations using Expanding Horizon (ANODE-EH)
- Neural Ordinary Differential Equations using Multiple Shooting (origin: DiffEqFlux.jl - multipleshoot) (NODE-MS)

## üìù Status of Results
_**Note! Loss Function, Current Status and Results need to be updated according to results and planned work.**_

**Status**:
- To be developed ‚ú®
- In development ‚è≥
- Ready for simulation üîú
- Results obtained ‚úÖ
